{"name":"Contavect","tagline":"Analyse DNA contaminants from NGS data","body":"#ContaVect\r\n=========\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nContavect was developped to quantify and caracterize DNA contaminants from gene therapy vector production after NGS sequencing. This automated pipeline can however be used for wider pourpose requiring to identify map NGS datasets consisting of a mix of DNA sequences on multiple references. It combine several features such as reference homologies masking, fastq filtering/adapter trimming, short read alignments, SAM file splitting and generating human readable output.\r\n\r\n##Principle\r\n\r\n\r\n### Dependencies:\r\n\r\nThe programm was developed under Linux Mint 16/17 and require a python 2.7 environment.\r\nThe following dependencies are required for proper program excecution:\r\n\r\n* [bwa 0.7.0+](https://github.com/lh3/bwa)\r\n* [samtools 0.1.17+](https://github.com/samtools/samtools)\r\n* blast+ (not required is not no reference masking is to be performed) \r\n\r\nIn addtion 2 third party python packages are also needed \r\n\r\n* [Biopython](https://github.com/biopython/biopython)\r\n* [pysam](https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam)\r\n\r\n## Get IsFinder\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repository\r\n``` bash\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/a-slide/ContaVect/ my_folder/\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Make the main script excecutable\r\n``` bash\r\n$ sudo chmod u+x IsFinder.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n3.Compile the ssw aligner (and add the dynamic library it to the path)\r\n\r\nIf you wish to perform a step of adapter trimming before mapping you need to complile the dynamic library ssw.so to be able to use the Smith watermann algorithm forked from mengyao's [Complete-Striped-Smith-Waterman-Library](https://github.com/mengyao/Complete-Striped-Smith-Waterman-Library)\r\n\r\nTo use the dynamic library libssw.so you may need to modify the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment\r\nvariable to include the library directory (export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD) or for definitive\r\ninclusion of the lib edit /etc/ld.so.conf and add the path or the directory containing the\r\nlibrary and update the cache by using /sbin/ldconfig as root\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nPrepare the configuration file to include your files and settings as indicated in the template Conf.txt file provided with the source files\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\n$ ./ContaVect.py Conf.txt......\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Pipeline development logbook\r\nTO BE INCLUDED\r\n* [Logbook]()\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contact\r\n\r\nAdrien Leger - 2014\r\n* <adrien.leger@gmail.com>\r\n* <adrien.leger@inserm.fr>\r\n* <adrien.leger@univ-nantes.fr>\r\n* [Github](https://github.com/a-slide)\r\n* [Atlantic Gene Therapies - INSERM 1089] (http://www.atlantic-gene-therapies.fr/)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
